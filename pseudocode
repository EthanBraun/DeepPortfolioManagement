train function():
	initialize pvm
	for # epochs:
		initialize portfolio value
		for each interval in the training set:
			# simulate
			pass current portfolio weights and price tensor into eiie
			overwrite pvm with output of network
			update portfolio value
			add current interval to pvm training stack
			
			# train	
			for # minibatches:
				randomly select minibatch interval from available data in pvm (according to geometric distribution)
				train network on minibatch (gradient ascent of reward function) and overwrite minibatch pvm
				
		print agent reward
